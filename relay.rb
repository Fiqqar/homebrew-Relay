# Homebrew formula for Relay.
#
# This repo IS the Homebrew tap for Relay: `brew tap Fiqqar/relay` resolves to
# github.com/Fiqqar/homebrew-relay and this formula is its canonical copy.
# The main Fiqqar/Relay repo no longer ships a formula (see its RELEASE.md).
#
# On every release, re-point `url` + `sha256` below to the new sdist asset
# (built by the Release workflow on the `v*` tag) and push.
#
# Released by `sdist` from the GitHub Release, built into a virtualenv.
