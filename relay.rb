# Homebrew formula for Relay.
#
# Install with (Homebrew >= 6 requires formulae to come from a tap, not a URL):
#   brew tap Fiqqar/relay https://github.com/Fiqqar/Relay
#   brew install Fiqqar/relay/relay
#
# (A conventional `brew tap Fiqqar/relay` alone would require the repo to be
# named `homebrew-relay`; the explicit URL above sidesteps that.)
#
# Released by `sdist` from the GitHub Release, built into a virtualenv.
